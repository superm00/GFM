brz_kilo_desc;Many peasants are discontent with our change to the Metric system, some in the northeast have begun a revolt against it. In the village of Fagundes, Paraiba, the water tanks, now measured in Metric, were attacked by these peasants as the first sparkle of revolt. Now more than 60 different areas in the Northeast have reported attacks from these so-called "Kilogram breakers".;;;;;;;;;
praieira_desc;Disgruntled Liberals in the Northeast have organised a Revolt against the government and authority of the Empire of Brazil and its Emperor, claiming such things as the underrepresentation of their and other provinces. The rebels demand liberty of the press, which until now has been censored in protection of the Monarchy, many of these rebels also demand a Republic. We must not let this happen.;;;;;;;;;

angola_purchase_title;The Angola Purchase;;;;;;;;; 
angola_purchase_desc;Angola is a long-established Portuguese colony in southern Africa, just across the Atlantic from us. Our rising position on the global stage makes it tempting to expand our borders beyond South America. Perhaps a price can be negotiated to buy Angola--putting us even further at an advantage over Portugal, our former colonial master.;;;;;;;;;  
EVTNAME47074;Brazil Offers to Purchase Angola;;;;;;;;; 
EVTDESC47074;With Brazil's rising status in the world, they have sought to expand their borders beyond South America. They have offered to purchase Angola from us for 100000 dollars. This will cripple our efforts to conquer more of Africa--but should we decide Angola is not worth keeping, the price is reasonable enough.;;;;;;;;;
EVT47074PTA;That price is tempting.;;;;;;;;; 
EVT47074PTB;Angola is ours. Its status is non-negotiable.;;;;;;;;; 
EVTNAME47075;Portugal Accepts the Angola Purchase;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA47077;Interesting indeed;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47078;The city of Rio de Janeiro, the capital of our great nation, suffers from a chronic lack of urban planning. Besides being inneficient, it also contibrutes to make diseases like small pox, bubonic plague, and yellow fever, spread like wildfire in the city. A series of urban reforms is needed to modernize the city and eradicate endemic diseases.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA47078;I'm sure this won't backfire!;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC47079;The population of Rio de Janeiro is rioting. The mayor using the great powers we given to him, destroyed slums and kicked people out of their houses in the process of modernizing the city, and to enforce the mandatory vaccination houses were being invaded. This measures brought the population to protest agains the mandatory vaccination, and the protests sparked a riot.;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA47081;A great man indeed;;;;;;;

This madman continues to spit poisonous words of Independence for the Mapuche tribes under his self-proclaimed Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia. We, of course, know this is nothing more than a case of somebody that might need to "take the train" and stop annoying us with such delusions. But the French and specially Mapuche might not be too happy with such an outcome.;;;;;;;;;

Later on, during the inauguration of the Museu Paulista Pedro Américo brought it to Brazil, where it received Innumerous positive reviews and exploded in popularity.

andrew_jackson_attack_desc;Today, President Andrew Jackson exited via the East Portico of the American Capitol after witnessing the Funeral of Warren D. Davis (A representative of the State of South Carolina.) Andrew was ambushed by Richard Lawrence: an unemployed Englishman who aimed a firearm at Jackson and proceeded to fire - most likely to the humid weather: the pistol misfired and did not kill Jackson. Lawrence drew a second pistol out of his jacket and attempted to assassinate the President for the second time, which too failed. Infuriated, President Andrew Jackson repeatedly hit his to be a murderer with a cane, to where the people present at the event had to hold Jackson fearing he would beat Richard to a pulp. The exact reasoning behind Richard's attempt is unknown. Jackson did not seem to be sane, without providing any logical reason behind his actions during different interrogations: Lawrence is in the Government Hospital for the Insane.;;;;;;;;;
garrafada_desc;Pedro was on a journey to the province of Minas Gerais to quench local federalist support before being forced to retreat to the Imperial capital. He found immense resistance from the nativist population caused by rumours implying he'd close the Congress and declare an absolutists Coup d'etat. Several Pedro-allied Portuguese merchants in Rio got together to plan a welcome-back party that backfired as the Liberal Brazilians perceived it as an "insult to the nation and all she stood for." All this indignation fuming out of the Nativist populous exploded into physical violence in the so-called "Night of Bottles.";;;;;;;;;
pedro_i_abdication_desc;Many Brazilians question the authoritarian tendencies of Dom Pedro I and his "Poder Moderador." Newspapers such as "Aurora Fluminense" in Rio protested against the Emperor and his peculiar political decisions. The tension escalates between the Liberals and Pro-Pedro politicians when forces allied to the Emperor murder Badaró (an Italian journalist) in an ambush causing great distress in the Liberal population. Dom Pedro attempted to quench the Liberal equivocacies such as in Minas Gerais caused by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos: Pedro wasn't successful in reducing the Liberal tensions in Minas and other Liberal demonstrations. Today, Pedro dissolves the old ministry installing one allied to him with two Portuguese Ministers, decisions that trigger a manifestation in the Campo de Aclamação demanding the return of the previous Ministers. Pedro's luck strikes once again as the Imperial troops join the protests leaving the then Emperor without any support from the Exército. Pedro's only choice was to abdicate.;;;;;;;;;
pnb_cabanada_desc;The Cabanada was a Conservative revolt in the regions of Agreste and Zona da Mata Nordestina that desired the return of Emperor Pedro I to the Brazilian throne, being against the Regencia Trina and Infante Dom Pedro II. The political and social fragility caused by the Emperor's abdication culminated in a Revolution headed by local landlords allied to the "Coluna do Trono do Altar" society in Portugal that sought the return of the now resignated Portuguese Emperor. The aforementioned landlords also cut relations with the Engenhos giving the revolt an anti-slavery flavour.;;;;;;;;;
rusga_desc;Since Brazil's independence, the nation's politics has had two political sects, a Liberal sect that sought higher autonomy for the various Provinces and the leftover Portuguese that defended a more centralised government alongside keeping their privileges. After Pedro's abdication, the country has plummeted into turmoil as tensions between these two sects have exponentially increased, leading to acts of violence against each other, such as the event known as "Rusga" in Mato Grosso. Fueled by Liberal societies such as "Sociedade dos Zelosos da Independência" and the "Sociedade Filantrópica," the Liberal mob attacked any Portuguese citizen they came across raiding their homes.;;;;;;;;;
fumaca_desc;The Revolta do Ano da Fumaça (Year of Fog) acquired this name due to a thick fog that settled in the province of Minas Gerais during the revolt. A group of Caramurus (Portuguese reactionaries) marched onto the capital (Ouro Preto,) utilising the fact that the Province president wasn't present. The Caraumurus were in their majority: Portuguese merchants who'd constantly complain about "despotic" actions by the current government. Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos organised a legitimate government in the city of São João D'el Rey as a response and sent 6.000 men toward Ouro Preto to quench the Restauradores.;;;;;;;;;

build_brasilia_desc;Since the times of Marquês do Pombal in Portugal, there have been talks about a new Brazilian capital. The Father of Brazilian Independence: José Bonifacio was the first to refer to this city as "Brasilia." Such a name comes from the formal demonym for those born in Brazil: "Brasiliense." The Portuguese word "Brasileiro" only defined those who traded or trafficked Brazil-Wood in the 1500s.;;;;;;;;;
brasilia_name_desc;Now that we have finished building the new capital in the interior, we need to choose a proper name for such a magnificent city. Some suggest we should name it after a well-known figure in our history.
