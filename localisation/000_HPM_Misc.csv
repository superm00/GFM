no_schools_desc;There's no organized school system or budget for education. The scarce literacy gain that is achieved comes from religious schools or it is based on informal community teaching, though these places get some funding, indirectly, from the government. Higher education institutions are either non existent or completely religious and medieval.\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%. If it is 50%, funding needs to be at least 20%. If it is 75%, funding needs to be at least 30%. Otherwise literacy will start to fall.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_schools_desc;A rudimentary school system exists in the capital and a few important cities but enrollment is completely optional. Schools limits themselves to teaching pupils how to read and write. There's no government agency to inspect schools and they have no common standards for teaching, with the few courses that exist being overcrowded. Private schools are commonly in the same conditions. Teachers don't have professional formation and are often just literate men, while pupils often leave school without being properly schooled.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 30%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

acceptable_schools_desc;Schools can be found in every major and most of the medium cities. A government agency exists to ensure quality standards in education and to inspect that proper facilities are used for it. Enrollment is encouraged and sometimes it's outright mandatory, but it's not properly enforced and pupils often don't go to school for a variety of reasons. Children are also taught math and a few other subjects. Education institutions for teenagers are starting to appear, and secular, higher education institutions for adults are common. Teachers are formally trained, but oftentimes poorly.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 40%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

good_schools_desc;Schools can be found in almost every city. Government agencies take education with the utmost seriousness, and enrollment is mandatory and tightly controlled. Children and teenagers are taught a variety of subjects besides reading and writing and teachers are taught pedagogy during their formation. Literacy campaigns for adults and the elderly are a part of the government's effort to eradicate illiteracy. Higher education institutions are considered good, with opportunities for the poor classes to enroll.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 50%.\nA fully funded education provides a bonus to this reform.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

synthetic_sulphur_factory_desc;Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF's Oppau plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year. During World War I, the production of munitions required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large sodium nitrate deposits in Chile controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort. Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of nitric acid, a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liquor_distillery_desc;The continuous still allowed the alcohol industry to reach new levels of productivity. The still consists of a first column (called the analyzer) in a column still that has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. It behaves like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPEEDEXPLAINED;So, in case you've been having problems with game speed, this event is for you. You may have already seen the performance submod that decreases terrain texture resolution for that purpose. Another thing can be done to increase performance, however it is a bit more difficult. \n 1. Go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\GFM\settings.txt \n 2. Find "update_time = 1.00000" in the file \n 3. Change it to "update_time = 100.00000" \n The issue with this is that it undoes itself every time you restart the game, so you either need to do it every time you start, or you can set the file to read only, however this makes the game unstable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

APRILUPRISING;Chaos reigns in Bulgaria as villages explode into revolt left and right. The Bulgarians' 480-year slumber has ended, and their awakening has sent us into a waking nightmare. An open revolt has begun, planned out by the secret Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee. The uprising has been divided into 4 seperate revolutionary districts with seperate command structures. Expat brigades of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee have crossed the Romanian border to aid their compatriots. Suffice to say fighting through every mountain village will be a bloody and protracted conflict, sure to attract the eyes of the international community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BLOODYLETTER;Brothers! \nYesterday, Neceb Aga came from Plovdiv to our village and demanded imprisoning several people, including me. I called up some brave men and after getting armed, we headed towards the konak and attacked it, killing the governor and some policemen. Now, as I write this letter, the flag waves before the konak, rifles shoot and the church bells echo simultaneously with them and men are kissing one another on the streets. If you, brothers, happen to be true patriots and apostles of freedom, then do follow our example in Panagyurishte. Koprivshtitsa, 20th April 1876 T. Kableshkov \n\nThe so-called 'Bloody Letter' was written in the blood of a local governor murdered by Bulgarian revolutionary Todor Kableshkov in an uprising. It has kicked off unrest across Bulgaria. We can only hope it doesn't get out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BATAKMASSACRE;Ahmet Aga, the Ottoman commander, had surrounded the village and said that he wanted all arms laid down. Trendafil, the rebel leader, went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him. I heard Ahmet Aga command for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. His words were "Shishak aor" which is Turkish for "to put on a skewer". They took all his money, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth, impaled him slowly on a stake and roasted him. I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women, surrounded by Bashi-Bazuk who forced us to watch what was happening. One of the children, Vladimir, still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her. Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, there in front of me. Trendafil's burnt bones stood there for a month before being buried. \n\nOttoman irregulars have massacred the inhabitants of the village of Batak, the last holdout of the Bulgarian rebels. They did so independently of high command, but the international community is in uproar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31716;The Construction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31716;Work on the foundations of the Eiffel Tower began. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block built of limestone each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. Each shoe was anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were complete by $YEAR$ and the erection of the ironwork began. For this part, we need to set a budget for the construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31717;The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from L'Independent and La Vanguardia completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large Catalan flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME9991011;The Leicester Balloon Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9991011;It occurred at a test flight of a new hydrogen balloon by aeronaut Henry Tracey Coxwell, for which 50,000 spectators attended. The crowd were enraged by rumours that the balloon was not the largest and newest of Coxwell's balloons. As tensions ran high, a woman was allegedly struck by a police officer trying to defend the balloon from the crowd, causing a riot. Coxwell's balloon was torn to shreds by the crowds, which caused the gas envelope to collapse as he fled, under attack from the crowd. The event set back scientific progress in the field of high-level flight and was of great expense to Coxwell who had to build a replacement balloon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC18481984;We agreed in the Treaty of 1843 to never take possession of any parts of the Hawaiian domain, but French colonists and merchants continue to clamor for annexing Hawaii into our empire. Added to our ordeal over this "Hawaiian Question" is the persecution of French Catholics, whom we ought to avenge. Gillaume Patrice Dillon, the current consul in Hawaii, despite having previously been given orders by us not to display any "pugnaciousness," agrees that a show of force is necessary against the Hawaiians. He writes that "it will prove sufficient to display a good French corvette for three days at Honolulu to force concessions from this devious and hypocritical Government." Admiral Louis Tromelin, who is currently anchored in Honolulu, has proposed sending a list of demands that would protect Catholics and increase our economic influence under the threat of invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRENCHHAWDEMANDS;France has sent a frigate under Admiral Louis Tromelin to deliver us a list of demands: the reduction of import duties on French brandy, the immunity of Catholic missionaries to our laws, the use of French as the language of communication between France and Hawaii, and the punishing of schoolboys who misbehave in Catholic churches.

adopt_the_peseta_desc;The Peseta is the currency used mainly in Northern Spain, and is regulated by a Central Bank, which is under government control.

If we nationalize and officialize the currency, commerce within our state and with the world would be more accessible and regulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPAFORCEDCONSTITUTION;The Spanish Constitution of 1845 would replace the Constitution of 1837, reverting many liberties granted for it. In May 1844 General Ramón María Narváez took over the government, the moderates were divided on the need to reform the 1837 Constitution then in force - even the most reactionary group led by the Marquis de Viluma advocated its repeal and the return to the charter granted by the Royal Statute of 1834. Narváez finally leaned towards the option of the reform defended by the group led by Alejandro Mon and Pedro José Pidal against the group of moderate "puritans" who defended its maintenance because its approval had been the result of consensus between the two large liberal parties, moderate and progressive, which would allow them to alternate in government without having to change the Constitution every time the government is changed. Our Queen, even if you are 14 years old, we have to ask: do you accept the new constitution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31723;News has reached us that engagements between rebel troops under General Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan and government troops have started in the town of Vicálvaro. The rebels demand the restoration of the 1837 Constitution which granted electoral and individual rights but was too liberal for our Queen, getting replaced in 1845 by a more conservative constitution. The rebels are well armed and fight with tenacity and hope, believing that they can overthrow the government and restore rights to the citizenry. Do we avoid more bloodshed and restore the constitution of 1837 or fight for our control over Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31724;The rebels under General Leopoldo O'Donnell have advanced into Madrid after defeating government forces in the town of Vicálvaro. Rebels are rising in other parts of Spain and are have gathered to surround Madrid. Do we continue fighting and hope for the best or give in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31725;Today our troops in the defence of Madrid have been victorious, and revolts in other parts of Spain are being put down by our glorious troops, defending our prestigious monarchy. Our country is in ruins and our people is tired of war, but Espartero escaped encirclement, alone with his horse, and retired to the countryside, where we hope he will die and dissapear from history. After all this bloodshed, we could try to calm our population, but doing so would also anger the reactionaries, which would search for rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31726;After a bloody war against the Carlists, pacts with them have been conducted in Lécera to establish the conditions of treatment of prisoners of war and regularization of exchanges, similar to the Elliot Convention in 1835.

EVTDESC31727;Today a revolt started in Barcelona against the government of Joaquín María López, who has breached the agreements with the Central Board for the overthrow of the government of Espartero, produced a few weeks earlier and in violation of various provisions in the 1837 constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31728;We have been told by informants that the federalist movement, concentrated laregly in the North of the country, is preparing for a revolt. The situation seems dire, especially in Catalonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31729;News has reached us that negotiations between the federalists of Vasconia and Catalonia concerning the prospect of rebellion have been finished. We can't let the federalists seize our precious lands, sweep away our traditions and way of life, destroy our economy, or even letting them capture our beloved capital for them to establish a corrupt democracy. We could spy them to prevent rebellion, but it's too late to fully prevent it. Do we disarm them by force or ignore the danger?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31730;Today engagements around the country are starting, and our forces are preparing for an impending civil war. Our people will have to suffer over it, or do we let them live in peace, and have all those "liberties" they want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31731;Today eight to ten thousand men rose to Empordà, Catalonia with the federal flag, decisively promoted for the suspension of the constitutional guarantees and the disarmament of the popular militias of Tortosa, Barcelona, Tarragona and other places in the always rebellious Catalonia.

Do we give them orders to fire or to move to more possible to defense land, like the Serralada Transversal to the West, or the Monseny to the South?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31732;Today rebellions in Valencia have started for the federalist cause.

EVTDESC31742;The lower house of the Spanish Parliament approved the creation of a Commonwealth today, but with limited powers compared to those originally envisioned for it by its promoters. On 18 December 1913 the king signed the law granting all Spanish provinces the right to group themselves into associations or commonwealths, Catalonia being the only commonwealth so planned. The first President of the Commonwealth of Catalonia will be, if done, Enric Prat de la Riba, of the Lliga Regionalista, who will led a programme to create an efficient infrastructure of roads and ports, hydraulic works, railways, telephones, charities and healthcare. The Commonwealth also wants to undertook initiatives to increase agricultural and forest yields, introducing technological improvements, the improvement of services and education, and promoting education in technologies necessary for Catalan industry. The last decision is for the Spanish Senate, which depends on us to finish their decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31743;'Spaniards: The enthusiastic welcome that the Liberal Army found in the villages, so heroically shown in Vicálvaro, the applause with which the news of our patriotic uprising has been received everywhere, they assure from now on the triumph of the freedom which we have sworn to defend. In a few days most of the provinces will have shaken the tyrants, the nation will enjoy the benefits of the representative regime. It is time, then, to say what we are determined to do in the matter of victory. We want the preservation of the throne, the rigorous practice of the fundamental laws, tax cuts, we want to uproot the peoples from that centralization, giving them the local independence necessary to preserve their culture, and as a guarantee of all this we want and raise, under solid foundations, the National Militia. These are our attempts, which we express frankly, without imposing them on the nation. We'll lay the definitive foundations of liberal regeneration to which we aspire. We have our swords consecrated to the national will, and we will not sheath them until it is fulfilled.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31744;Inspired by Espartero's patriotic federalist manifesto, the people have risen up against our government and surrounded the King's Palace, forcing us to agree to an armistice and negotiate peace. As we lack support of the populace and the necessary soldiers, the only thing we can do is give the rebels what they want and stop the bloodshed that has struck our great nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31745;3 days ago a draft constitution was presented to the progressive parliament and approved. This constitution follows a strongly progressive and liberal ideology, reaffirming the principle of national sovereignty in an absolute way. All institutions, including the Crown, would find their foundation in the will of the Nation, it would also grant a wide range of political rights and install, for the first time in Spain, a religiously tolerant system of governance. Its articulation is broader and more complete than that contained in the Constitution of 1837 and the Constitution of 1845. It is a rigid constitution, as it establishes a rather tedious reform procedure. Regardless, yesterday, General Leopoldo O'Donnell staged a counter-revolution, launching a coup that has put and end to the progressive biennium. He has decreed the closure of the Constituent Assembly elected in 1854 and cancelled the Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THEGREATGATSBY;The Great Gatsby, a book by Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, has been published today. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan. The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's cover art greatly impressed Fitzgerald and he incorporated aspects of it into the novel. This tragic work of literature is one of the best of the genre and is sure to remain a classic for generations to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHARLESLINDFLIGHT;Charles Lindbergh, an obscure air mail pilot made history today by completing the first solo flight over the Atlantic from Roosevelt Field, Long Island to Le Bourget Aerodrome, Paris in his purpose-built, single-engine Ryan monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis. His monoplane was loaded with 450 U.S. gallons (1,704 liters) of fuel that was strained repeatedly to avoid fuel line blockage. The fully loaded aircraft weighed 2.7 tons (2329 kilograms), with takeoff hampered by a muddy, rain-soaked runway. Lindbergh's monoplane was powered by a J-5C Wright Whirlwind radial engine and gained speed very slowly during its 7:52 AM takeoff, but cleared telephone lines at the far end of the field by about twenty feet. Over the next 33 and a half hours, Lindbergh and the Spirit faced many challenges, which included skimming over storm clouds at 10,000ft (3,000m) and wave tops at as low as 10ft (3m). He landed at Le Bourget Aerodrome at 10:22 PM on Saturday, May 21st. A crowd estimated at 150,000 stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the cockpit, and carried him around above their heads for 'nearly half an hour'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16121916;A team of 12 fearless mountaineers and 60 porters travelled to the foot of Mount Everest and set up a base camp to prepare an ascent. This Mount Everest expedition of 1924 is our second attempt to reach the top of the world after the failure two years prior. Both expeditions have been financed by the Royal Geographical Society, the Alpine Club, and a major contribution by Captain John Noel. After two summit attempts had to be broken off despite setting a world altitude record of 28,126 feet (8572 m), the mountaineers George Mallory and Andrew "Sandy" Irvine set out on a third and final bid for the peak - and were never seen again. The last sighting was Noel Odell's claim to have watched two black dots on the 2nd step (cliff face) of the Northeast ridge, ascending it in roughly 5 minutes. Nobody knows whether they reached the peak before perishing. Today, the surviving expedition members erected a memorial cairn in honour of the men who never returned from Mount Everest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LEMANSSTARTS;Today the first '24 Hours of Le Mans' race has taken place, running along public roads near the name-giving city. It is planned to be a three-year event, the winner being declared by which driver could go the farthest distance over three consecutive 24-hour races, being awarded the Rudge-Whitworth Triennial Cup. For now, winners who covered the largest distance in a single 24-hour race are declared annually. Twenty car manufacturers constructed special racecars for the event, all from France aside from Bentley from Great Britain and Excelsior from Belgium. The victory in the first race went to the Chenard-Walcker team and their Bentley. Although they were delayed by stones smashing a headlight and puncturing the fuel tank, in the end the team of René Léonard / André Lagache and Christian Dauvergne / Raoul Bachmann won a comfortable 1–2 victory. The race has been an excellent exhibition of machine endurance and reliability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOUBAGHLAREVOLT;An insurrection has begun in the mountains surrounding in Benni Abbes against our colonial rule. Intense unrest among Maghrebis and Berbers in the region has lead to civilians supplying the rebels. Chérif Boubaghla, a skilled guerilla tactician, is at the head of the insurrection, organizing the mountains tribes into raiding parties who ambush our forces and vanish again like strokes of lightning. Today, an attack on Chellata wreaked havoc on the local administration. Sheriff Benali, chief of the Zaouia of Chelatta has reproached our forces for failing to prevent Boubaghla's attack, deciding to join him in rebellion. If we don't do anything, more and more chieftains will begin joining the revolt. The battle for Kabylia has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSASSINATIONAGARFIELD;James A. Garfield, 20th president of the United States, has been shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C.. Garfield was scheduled to leave Washington on for his summer vacation, which was reported in the Washington newspaper. Charles J. Guiteau, a mentally ill lawyer who was fantasizing about Garfield being politically indebted to him therefore knew to lay in wait at the train station, preparing to shoot him. At 9:30AM, as Garfield entered the station's waiting room, Guiteau stepped forward and shot him at point-blank range from behind. Garfield cried out, 'My God, what is that?', flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again, and Garfield collapsed. While Guiteau was quickly arrested, the president has been severly injured, suffering internal hemorrhaging. He will probably not survive to see the end of the year, and that after only having been president for four months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSASSINATIONWMCKINLEY;News has reached us that William McKinley, 25th president of the United States, was shot in the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He was shaking hands with the public when anarchist Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen. McKinley had attended the exhibition to hold speeches with the goal of convincing the attendees of the importance of protective tariffs. Aside from this official purpose, he also took time to enjoy the fair and meet fairgoers in scheduled public receptions such as the one at the Temple of Music that lead to the shooting. McKinley is currently in critical condition. Of the two bullets Czolgosz fired at him, one deflected off a button but the other penetrated his abdomen, lodging in his back. While the bullet itself is no longer dangerous now that it has stopped moving, its path through McKinley's gut is very concerning. If it gets infected, the president doesn't have much longer to live. While doctors are optimistic, McKinley's chances are slim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iasi_national_theatre_title;The Iasi National Theatre;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iasi_national_theatre_desc;The first building in Iasi arranged to host theater performances was the "Théâtre des Variétés" (Variety Theater) built in 1832. As the number of local or passing theatrical troupes increased, the building quickly became too small. Thus, the need for a grand theatre the likes of which is common in great European cities has arisen. Construction has been proposed to take place in the building which had served as palace to Ionita Sandu Sturdza, ruler of Moldavia from 1822 to 1828. Architect Alexandru Costinescu has made plans for refitting the ground floor into a huge amphitheater surrounded by three rows of loges and crowned with a gallery and large stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

german_npolarexp2_desc;August Petermann, an expert on cartography and geography has proposed an expedition to the North Pole at a Geographic assembly in Frankfurt organized by the 'Freier Deutscher Hochstift'. Petermann firmly believes in the questionable theory of the open polar sea, concluding that beyond a thin belt of drift ice, the sea surrounding the North Pole is itself devoid of ice. Although Petermann ambitiously hopes that the expedition might reach the pole after clearing the purported ice zone and reaching the open sea, it would still be of great academic value to explore and scientifically analyze the waters and islands of the far North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Goals of the expedition include discovering new species of marine fauna and flora, conducting deep sea soundings, bottom dredges, open water trawls and serial water temperature observations and surveying and exploring antarctic waters. The ambitious 127,580km journey requiring a crew of 216 lead by 21 officers would certainly be arduous. Experts have predicted 'a great advance in the knowledge of our planet' would be reached by the expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SISIASSASSINATION;60-year-old empress Elisabeth, also popularly known as Sisi, traveled incognito to Geneva where she had been invited to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage. After the death of her only son, Rudolf, in the so-called Mayerling Incident, where he commited murder-suicide together with his lover Baroness Mary Vetsera, she sank deep into melancholy. Elisabeth began wearing long black dresses and carried a white parasol, going on trips throughout Europe to distract herself from her misery. On the fateful day of her arrival in Geneva, as Elisabeth and her lady-in-waiting were walking along a promenade leading to a steamer which they intended to take to cross lake Geneva, 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them. After peering underneath the empress's parasol, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand as if he wanted to maintain his balance. In reality, he stabbed Elisabeth with a four-inch-long sharpened needle file. She died shortly after boarding the steamer, having been Queen for 44 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HALIFAXEXPLOSION;This morning, the SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship laden with high explosives, collided with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo in the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the Mont-Blanc led to a massive explosion that devastated the Richmond district of Halifax. 1,782 people have been killed, largely in Halifax and Dartmouth, by the blast, debris, fires, or collapsed buildings, and an estimated 9,000 others have been injured. This blast was the largest man-made explosion in history. Preliminary investigations have concluded that both ships were to blame for the collision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EUREKAREBELS;The Victorian gold rush began in 1851, bringing masses of migrants into the area to seek their fortune in the mines. The local government sought to profit from the boom by issuing a mining tax of 30 shillings a month. Furious gold miners organized in protest, eventually escalating to ten thousand people swearing allegiance to a newly proclaimed secessionist republic. The conflict erupted into battle when 280 soldiers engaged 190 miners, resulting in around 50 deaths and the arrest of the agitants. While the worst offenders are now behind bars and the secessionist sentiments have been quelled, this incident has still caught the attention of all of Australia, laying the seeds for future unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The sale of wives and daughters into human trafficking has become common due to the chaos that has ravaged the region. Traffickers are reported to regularly drive groups of thousands of women South from the barren lands of Shansi and Honan to the East and South. The famine may be caused by opium plantations being placed where rice once grew, lowering rice output available to the populace combined with crop failure caused by a drought due to el Niño.

He is gathering forces in one last glorious attempt to capture Kashgar for islam but lacks funding. Sponsoring his holy war would be costly but hopefully a decisive blow against Qing rule in Sinkiang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
QIHEZHUOREBELLION;With support from the Khanate of Kokand, Kata Tiaole, the heir to the Khoja dynasty which we drove from Sinkiang in 1759, has invaded over the mountains and captured the city of Kashgar. The Khojas have long been a thorn in our side, last invading the area in 1830. If we defeat them decisively here and now on the field of battle, we may be rid of them for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAGASAKIINCIDENT1;The Beiyang fleet docked in Nagasaki in a visit as part of their tour of various major Asian harbors as a show of force. 500 sailors took part in shore leave, going to the red-light district, where during an altercation with locals, they were blamed for damaged fixtures. Locals also claimed that drunken sailors went around the city pursuing women and children, causing an outrage. Nagasaki Prefecture Police Department tried to intervene together with a large number of local civilians. As a result, the policemen and sailors, using swords purchased from stores, began to fight hand-to-hand in sword battles within the city, causing at least 80 deaths. This is sure to cause diplomatic tensions with Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CAVITEMUTINY;A dangerous trend in the Philippines has become apparent: the willingness for Filipinos to resist Spanish rule through armed revolt, including those in the colonial army and workforce. Today, around 200 Filipinos staged a mutiny in Cavite's San Felipe Fort. These rebels primarily were soldiers and laborers employed in the Cavite arsenal, the latter of whom deeply resented how their exemption from paying tribute to the Spanish government was revoked. Other grievances included the refusal by the Spanish to pay for tobacco from Filipino farmers as well as the use of forced labor. The mutiny, nevertheless, was unsuccessful, and our troops executed many of the participants. The Catholic priests turned mutiny leaders Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora--collectively known as Gomburza--have in particular become immortalized as martyrs after their execution, since the Filipinos assert these men were not given a fair trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_shakespeare_title;Shakespeare's Mission to Khiva;;;;;;;;;;;;;
send_shakespeare_desc;Russia has long been scheming to conquer the Khanate of Khiva. While their last attempt in 1717 was pushed back, news has reached us of a large force gathering in Orenburg that is clearly being assembled for a march across the steppe into Khiva. Russia's primary justification for their aggression against the Khanate is their holding of many Russian fishermen captured from the eastern Caspian as slaves. Major d'Arcy Todd of our mission to Herat has suggested sending his political assistant, Richmond Campbell Shakespear, as an emissary to Khiva to attempt to convince the Khan to release the Russian slaves, thus removing the Russian pretext for war. However, we do not know whether Russia will already have inavaded Khiva by the time he would arrive, nor whether he would be able to survive the dangerous journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEAREINKHIVA;An strangely-clothed man has arrived in Khiva from the southern desert, claiming to be a representative from the distant country known as Great Britain. He urges Khan Allah Quli Bahadur to issue an order to release all Russian slaves in our domain so he may bring them across the steppe to the Russian frontier. His reasoning is that Russia is angered by our keeping of the slaves, around 450 in number, and is thus likely to invade us in the near future if we insist on keeping them. Indeed, Russia has on several occasions demanded that we release our Russian slaves. Should we follow the recommendations of this strange man and let him take them to Russia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARENOTINKHIVA;It has been a long time since Richmond Shakespear set out North from Herat to try to reach Khiva in an attempt to persuade the Sultan to release his Russian slaves, thus depriving the Tsardom of a pretext for war. Sadly, we have heard nothing back from him. He evidently perished on the dangerous journey across the lawless tribal lands on his path North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARESUCCESFULRUS;A bedraggled group of 416 former slaves has arrived at one of our forts on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea led by a Brit by the name of Richmond Campbell Shakespear. He claims to have travelled from Herat up the Oxus on a mission to persuade the khan of Khiva to release his Russian slaves, an endeavor which he succeeded in. While morally just and an excellent outcome for the freed slaves, this move on the board of the Great Game was clearly meant by the Brits to deprive us of our reason to invade Khiva.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHAKESPEARESUCCESFULENG;Richmond Campbell Shakespear has arrived on a ship from St. Petersburg to a celebratory welcome in London. After travelling from Herat along the Oxus to Khiva, he met with the Khan who he reports to have been a gentleman, not at all the cruel tyrant he was rumored to be. After some deliberation, the khan agreed to let Shakespear journey across the steppe to the Russian frontier with the slaves. The Russians, while glad to have their people back, were obviously angered to have lost their pretext to invade Khiva. Thanks to Shakespear's heroism, we have gained an edge in the struggle of the Great Game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHUBARALSITRI;The Shi'ite cleric Shubar al-Sitri was pushed out Bahrain today after a failed coup attempt to bring the country under Persia's sphere of influence. He had gathered weapons from the northern Arabian towns al-Hasa and Qatif to do so, then attempted to negotiate a collaboration with the Persian Shah, Nasser al-Din Qajar. But while al-Sitri was given support from the Shah, he failed to receive enough manpower due to Persia's preoccupation with contesting the European powers and maintaining internal stability. The failed coup, nevertheless, brought much bloodshed, with scores of Bedouin tribesmen fleeing to Qatar for refuge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VICEROYMAYODED;Richard Burke, 6th Earl of Mayo, the Viceroy of India, was assassinated today in Port Blair, Andaman Islands, during an inspection of the port's penal settlement. The assassin was a convict there, named Sher Ali Afridi, a Punjabi veteran of the British Army serving life in prison for murdering a relative during a feud. His murder of Lord Mayo was part of his plan to avenge his incarceration by killing two high-ranking British officials, since he thought the life sentence was too severe. Lord Mayo's body is being prepared for its return to his native Ireland, while Afridi awaits execution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEATHHAWYARD;News has reached us that George W. Hayward was murdered while passing through Chitral. He was on his way north to map the desolate Pamir mountains. Officials had warned him of the danger awaiting him in many of the lawless areas he would pass through, but he proceeded anyway, even carrying with him expensive gifts for Pamiri rulers to endear them to the Brits. These gifts would also, however, make him a target. After passing through Chitral and entering the mountains to the north, Hayward was said to have been ambushed by Chitrali tribesmen who murdered him in cold blood and looted his gifts. They were said to have been delivered to the amir of Chitral, who is rumored to have been complicit in the killing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STODDARTKIDNAPPED;Reports have reached us about yet another humiliating loss of a British diplomat in our interminable quest to win the upper hand in Central Asia. Colonel Charles Stoddart has been kidnapped and imprisoned on orders of Emir Nasrullah Khan of Bukhara. Initially dispatched to negotiate a treaty of friendship with Britain and the release of Russian prisoners, Stoddart was taken utterly by surprise by his arrest. We suspect Nasrullah wishes to use Stoddart as a pawn to persuade Britain to leave Central Asia. We can send in another diplomat to plea for Stoddart's release, though it's unlikely we could negotiate it and still keep a good standing in Bukhara. Captain Arthur Conolly would do for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STODDARKLLD;Our bid to rescue Charles Stoddart has come to a tragic end. Failing to negotiate Stoddart's release, Captain Arthur Conolly has himself been arrested, and both men have been beheaded for spying for Britain. Stoddart was put through hell over his time in prison, kept in a twenty-foot-deep hole infested with vermin with other common criminals. The conditions of his imprisonment changed with the Emir's fickle mind, which in turn flip-flopped as he estimated Britain's power in Central Asia, then abused Stoddart accordingly when we were at a geopolitical disadvantage. The pleas of Britain, Russia, the Ottomans, and even Khiva and Kokand could not persuade the Emir to release him. May both men rest in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;

TASHKENTJERUSSIA;Sometimes mutiny can be for the better. General Mikhail Cherniaev has acted against our order not to advance on Tashkent, sieging it over two days despite a stiff defense. He has allowed Russia to annex Tashkent as an autonomous khanate, and he shall be rewarded for his efforts with medals. Nevertheless, we should replace him to ensure our future orders are followed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALE;After a French cargo ship carrying 98 tons of goods capsized off the coast of Salé, Morocco, a few tons of the cargo were salvaged and stored in Salé itself. For us to have believed these goods would be kept safe, though, was foolish: the locals are scavenging the goods with abandon with little interference from Moroccan authorities. This is a clear act of piracy and merits punishment. All we have to do is say the words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALEMOR;The French have voiced outrage at locals in Salé for alleged piracy. After one of their cargo ships capsized and some of its goods were transported to the city, residents began to loot them with minimal interference from our authorities. France demands compensation, which if denied would mean a strong military action from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PIRACYINSALEREPAID;Morocco has agreed to compensate us for the stolen goods. We have no more of a quarrel with them for now, though let it be clear that we will exact concessions from them if they ever challenge our authority again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TROLLINGINSALE;Morocco has refused to compensate us for the stolen goods. They have no business escalating this tension, should they not wish to have our military unleashed upon them. Their wrongs must be made right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVENGEFORSALE;France has heavy-handedly responded to our refusal to compensate them, navally bombarding Salé as revenge. With the only thing preventing their military from descending on us like demons out the gates of hell being their restraint, we are totally at Paris's mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRETEONEEIGHTFOURONE;While we squabble with the Egyptians over our borders, calls for the reunification of the Greek island of Crete with the Greek mainland have been growing louder. Cretans have petitioned the Great Powers to sponsor a revolt for their independence, most notably Britain, who is rumored to have designs on the island to expand their naval presence in the Mediterranean. Undeservedly confident in their odds of liberation, a revolt has erupted in Crete--one which, needless to say, must be smothered in its infancy before it becomes too dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
POTASHSTASSFURT;A potash deposit has been found in the town of Staßfurt in Saxony-Anhalt. Mining for this precious salt has already begun, as it is used to produce sought-after fertilizers. Two seperate shafts have been dug--the 'von der Heydt' and the 'von Manteuffel.' These mining efforts are already bringing plentiful and lucrative results. An economic boom has begun, bringing much wealth and prosperity to the now flowering town of Staßfurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

india_je_russia_title;The Duhamel Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
india_je_russia_desc;General Alexander Osipovich Duhamel proposes a radical response to the war with Britain: an invasion of British India. The plan would involve a primary route through Persia and Afghanistan into India by means of the Khyber Pass, which leads into the Peshawar Valley. Duhamel hopes that Russia could build an alliance with the Sikh Empire and prod the locals into a rebellion against the British, particularly the Muslims of Northern and Western India. The plan also has seven alternate routes that make use of passage through Persia and the Turkic sultanates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIA;Russia has formally requested access to our territory in hopes of passing through to India for an invasion. Such an invasion is part of its campaign against the British in the Crimean War: Russia intends to create a new front for them to relieve their siege on the Russian mainland. Should we accept, though, it could mean allowing Russia to build influence in our country without any restraint due to the great powers' intervention. Our people surely would not approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIAACCEPTS;Our request to $FROM$ has been accepted: we now may turn the war's tide by invading India. We will bring Britannia to its knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
INDIAJERUSSIAREFUSES;Our request to $FROM$ has been denied. Our daring invasion plan must now be put to rest, unless we were to go to war with $FROM$ to force them to change their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CANVUONGMOVEMENT;A large-scale rebellion against our rule in Vietnam has broken out. The rebels have christened their effort as the Cân Vuong Movement, with Cân Vuong meaning "aid the king." With this said, the revolt lacks centralization, no doubt due to the heavy regional autonomy the Kingdom of Vietnam was given prior to our campaign to annex it. Its activities primarily involve regional leaders' troops attacking our forces. Of course, any violence against our noble troops must be met with a devastating response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MISSIONOFTHEVIXEN;The British schooner Vixen was detained today off the Caucasian coast by the Russian brig Ajax. The detention comes as a result of foreign vessels being barred from entry into Turkish waters past the Dardanelles, per the 1830 Treaty of Adrianopole. The Vixen had eight on-board guns and 28,000 pounds of gunpowder confiscated by Russian authorities. The British consul of Constainople, David Urquhart, was on board the schooner as it was captured. \n\nWhen looking between the lines of this incident, however, there is a whole other dimension to it. It seems the Vixen's detention was set up by Urquhart to provoke a conflict with Russia. The native Circassian peoples of the Caucasus have British support for their independence, and their liberation would do a service to British trade with Turkey and around the Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MISSIONOFTHEVIXENLESGO;Russia has released the Vixen and David Urquhart unharmed. We are relieved to not be dragged into a war due to Urquhart picking a fight with an enemy he has no business provoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MISSIONOFTHEVIXENRUSNO;Russia has refused to release the Vixen and David Urquhart. Such an escalation could certainly mean war--and we must choose our reaction wisely. Will we use this opportunity to fight on behalf of Circassia to advance our interests in the Black Sea, regardless of how many casualties we may face against the Russian Bear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SANKINKOTAI;Sankin Kotai is a system obligating all daimyo to have permanent residences in Edo to enforce their fealty to the Shogun. With thousands of nobles entering and departing from Edo each day, the city has a reputation for its opulent processions as these men make their daily commutes. Dissatisfaction with the Shogun's policies, however, has led to this system becoming less effective, evidenced by how unstable the relationship between the Shogun and daimyo currently is. It is best to have tradition take a back seat and let the daimyo live wherever they wish. They will thank us in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
