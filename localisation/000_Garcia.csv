EVTDESC4207008;GFM has added a mechanic for straits that prevents passing them if both sides are controlled by a country you are at war with. For example, here's the Strait of Gibraltar. Movement from sea tile A to sea tile B and vice versa is impossible if both control tiles, Tetouan and Gibraltar, are controlled by an enemy country. These control tiles have a province modifier labeling them so that their function is clear. However, a side effect of this system is that ships will, unless the strait is blocked by enemy control tiles, not actually pass through the province in the middle of the strait, in this case B. So, if you want to place a navy to engage enemy fleets who want to pass through the strait in battle, do so in front of or behind the strait, in this case on tile A or C.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

zollverein_title;The Zollverein;;;;;;;;;;;;;
zollverein_desc;The Zollverein is a proposed organization of German States managing tariffs and economic policies in unison inspired by the creation of a variety of custom unions among some German states in 1818. The foundation of the Zollverein would be the first instance in history in which independent states form a full economic union without the simultaneous creation of a political federation or union. This could help our nation to assert our influence above the accepting German states and make the economy of the German people more dynamic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207013;The Prussian government has approached us requesting our integration into the Zollverein, a customs union among the German states of Europe. The Zollverein is purely a customs union and does not involve in any way the sovereignty of the nation. However, it could also mean that we are kneeling to Prussian influence. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207015;The Definitive Restoration Plan has been proposed by the Conservative party in order to restore the monarchy in Mexico, and creating a constitutional empire following 4 important principles:\n1. The Mexican Nation is and will be independent, sovereign, and will take for the third time the heroic denomination of 'Imperio de Anáhuac'.\n2. The Empire's religion is and will be the apostolic and roman catholicism, without any public tolerance for other religions.\n3. The nation's form of government will be the one of a Constitutional Monarchy, hereditary, according to the habits or cultures and necessities of the country.\n4. The nation proclaims Agustín Jerónimo de Iturbide as the Emperor of Mexico. In case he does not accept, the crown will be for Antonio de Hero y Tamaríz. In case he also does not accept, the Emperor will be elected by the courts.\nWhat should we do? This may be an opportunity to appease the conservative opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207016;'Slavery and caste distinctions are outlawed for ever, and may everyone be equal.' -José María Morelos y Pavón. Mexican officer during the Mexican War for Independence and national hero.\n\nThe Underground Railway to Mexico is a network that helps thousands of slaves to escape into Mexico. Because of our constitution, every slave that sets foot in Mexican soil is considered free, and for many afro-american slaves in the American South, escaping to Mexico has been their salvation. Although there have been considerably more slaves crossing the Mason-Dixon line, some others even escaping into Canada, with the USA declaring the Fugitive Slave Act, it's clear that nowehere in the United States are slaves safe and sound. An approximate of 10,000 slaves have escaped into Mexico throughout this period, data is unclear as some of the convoys tend to be spotted and some don't even make it into Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207017;The Tordesillas Treaty had several modifications throughout history, we could decide on these two options, one claiming the entirety of the Amazons and one for claiming only the Western part of the Amazons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207018;With the General Colonization Law back, we can make sure to enforce these policies on every province in the North. This includes possible new lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207019;The Mier Expedition or the Somervell Expedition is an ongoing military operation from the Texans against Mexican settlements in the north. The attack is apparently in revenge for the "Dawson Massacre", as well as for economic and territorial purposes, most notably the land between the Rio Grande and Nueces river.
